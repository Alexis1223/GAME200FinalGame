PENNY
Mom, you’re alright!
MOM
Penumbra, what are you doing here?
PENNY
Checking on you! Aunt Malina was worried, she said-
MOM
Aunt who? Oh, while you’re here hon, do you mind checking our comm channel? I think some stranger managed to get on the line.
PENNY 
Mom, that’s your sister! You don’t remember her?
MOM
Don’t remember… Um. Excuse me miss, do I know you?
PENNY
ME?!
MOM
Yes, you. You remind me of someone. Ah, forget it, it’s probably nothing. I’d better head home.
PENNY
Mo- Artemisia, stay here. Wh… who did this to you? Wait, what’s that in your hand?
MOM
A rail ticket to the Outer Expanse. I don’t know why though…
PENNY
Then that’s where I’m off to next. I’ll fix this. I promise I’ll fix this. Please, just… stay safe.
